## Email Checker
Email fraudulent is prevalent in the technological community these days. Many websites don't have the functionality to check whether an email entered by the user exists. They check the email using a straightforward verification method that any user can easily breakthrough. Hence, checking if the email exists is very important. This application will return whether the email even exists or not. For example, domain@example.com does not exist, but agarwalmegh2004@gmail.com exists. My application uses the DNS and MX records and checks whether the email exists and is made using Nodejs.
